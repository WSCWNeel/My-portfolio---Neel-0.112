    <h1> Year 11 Low Poly Character </h1>
    <br>
    <p>Hello, my name is Neel Pillai and I'm gonna show you my 3D low poly character that shows my coding skills that is meant for my end users. My 3d Poly Character will be a humanoid being</p>
      <br>
      <h1>End users</h1>
    <p>My end users are adults who are 18+. They would prefer whatever I coded to be not to flashy and bright and not too dull. They would also be from anywhere in the world so languages like english would be ideal.</p>
  <br>
  <h1>Aesthetics</h1>
  <br>
    <h6>need rigging for poly characters to animate and move it <h3>
 <h3> need arms, legs, torso, head, hair and creepiness or cuteness factor</h3>
<h3> it also needs to be |-| |_| |\/| /-\ |\| () | |) |!||!|</h3>
      <br>
      <h1>Explanations</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Aesthetics are there so the character looks nice and interesting.</p>
      <p>Funtionality of my character is to be interesting and work with the set controls for the game it's in.</p>
      <p>Usability of my character is to not glitch or be buggy at all and run smoothly with the rest of the game.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I will also make these things happen by :-</p>
        <li>By testing the character model multiple times to make sure the animation isn't buggy</li>
          <li>I'll also make it work well with the speed it will be given in the game by testing how good the running speed of the character is compared to the running speed of it in game</li>
          <li>I'll make it loog good by designing it with good and interesting colors</li>
          <br>
          <p> This character that I am making is my own intellectual property since I am not copying anybody elses work</p>
          <p>I can prove this as when I make my character and publish it, anybody can search it online and not find a single image of it online.</p>
