    <h1> Development Page</h1>
   <br>
   <p> This is where I will be talking about the development process behind the things I showcase on my project showcase page. Such as for example the creation behind my character.</p>
   <br>

<div style="width:1514px; height:300px; border:2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255);">

<img src="version_1_low_polygon_plan.png" style="width:305px; height:260px; float:right; margin:20px;">

<p style="margin:10px;">The picture on the left is the character design plan that I plan to make, I designed it this way since this is the only character I could think of at the time of making was this.</p>
<br>
<p>"Needs to be less complicated"</p>
<p>"Make improvements to the legs"</p>
<br>
<p>The design on the right is the character design plan improved, I improved the leg of the character and also improved the overlook, but I had to scale it down but it's still better than before since I had 2 different designs weirdly combined before that as you can see from the image on the left.</p>

<h1> Year 11 Low Poly Character </h1>
<br>
<p>Hello again, overhere I'm gonna show you my 3D low poly character that shows my coding skills that is meant for my end users.</p>
<h1>End users</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
<p>My end users are adults who are 18+. They would prefer whatever I coded to be not to flashy and bright and not too dull. They would also be from anywhere in the world so languages<p>
<p>like english would be ideal. They would also like that my character wouldn't be too childish and maybe barely PG-13 and that the character itself will have high quality animations.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
  <h1>Aesthetics:</h1>
  <p>are there so the character looks nice and interesting.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>Funtionality:</h1>
  <p>of my character is to be interesting and work with the set controls for the game it's in.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>Usability:</h1>
<p>of my character is to not glitch or be buggy at all and run smoothly with the rest of the game.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <br>
<h3>I need rigging for poly characters to animate and move it<h3>
<h3> I need arms, legs, torso, head, hair and creepiness or cuteness factor</h3>
<h3> I also need to design it to be |-| |_| |\/| /-\ |\| () | |) |!||!|</h3>
<h3>The character that I will be designing will kinda look like a final boss, a knight armor with no soul, with an interesting spiky design</h3>
  <br>
  <h1>Explanations for the Overview</h1>
  <p>I will also make these things happen by :-</p>
    <li>By testing the character model multiple times to make sure the animation isn't buggy</li>
      <li>I'll also make it work well with the speed it will be given in the game by testing how good the running speed of the character is compared to the running speed of it in game</li>
      <li>I'll make it loog good by designing it with good and interesting colors</li>
      <br>
      <p> The character I am making or have made is my own intellectual property since I am not copying anybody elses work</p>
      <p>I can prove this as when I make my character and publish it, anybody can search it online and not find a single image of it.</p>
