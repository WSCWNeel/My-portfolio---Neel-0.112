        <h1> Year 11 Low Poly Character </h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hello again, overhere I'm gonna show you my 3D low poly character that shows my coding skills that is meant for my end users.</p>
        <h1>End users</h1>
          <br>

          <br>
          <br>
        <p>My end users are people that are 10+. They would prefer whatever I coded to not be too simple and not too boring. They would also be from anywhere in the world so languages<p>
        <p>like english would be ideal. They would also like that my character wouldn't be too childish and maybe barely PG-13 and that the game would be based on geographical knowledge of this country.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Requirements:</h1>
        <h3>The requirements for my atlas game is a semi ai so that the game itself can check and see whether the answers it gives and the ones that are given by the user are correct and also so it can remove and re-add things that have been used in the lists and also the conclusion and introduction as they both explain how to play the game and how many points you got as well after losing or finishing the game.</h3>
          <h1>Future Proofing:</h1>
          <p>are there so the game can be used by others who want to work on this project in the future.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1>Funtionality:</h1>
          <p>of the atlas game is to be interesting and work with the set controls that the atlas game has itself and also function well.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1>Usability:</h1>
        <p>of the atlas game is to not glitch or be buggy at all and run smoothly.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <br>
        <h3>I need a type of ai that can check whether it and the user is writing the correct words for the game and also if the same for the computer/ai itself as well as it'll play with the user<h3>
        <h3> I also need to debug the atlas game a lot</h3>
        <h3> I need to have comments above each of my important code so people can ynderstand what it is<h3>          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1>Explanations for the Overview</h1>
          <b><p>I will also make these things happen by :-</p>
            <h3><li>By testing the atlas game multiple times to make sure the semi-ai checker isn't buggy</li>
              <li>I'll also make the atlas game work without any bugs by checking the code again and again and doing multiple playtests</li>
                <li>I'll make the atlas game future proof by adding commeents that are clear and understandable</li></b></h3>
              <br>
              <p> The game I am making or have made is my groups own intellectual property since I am not copying anybody elses work</p>
              <p>I can prove this since if you look at other atlas games .</p>
