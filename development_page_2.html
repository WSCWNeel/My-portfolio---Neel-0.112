        <h1> Year 11 Low Poly Character </h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hello again, overhere I'm gonna show you my 3D low poly character that shows my coding skills that is meant for my end users.</p>
        <h1>End users</h1>
          <br>

          <br>
          <br>
        <p>My end users are people that are 10+. They would prefer whatever I coded to not be too simple and not too boring. They would also be from anywhere in the world so languages<p>
        <p>like english would be ideal. They would also like that my character wouldn't be too childish and maybe barely PG-13 and that the game would be based on geographical knowledge of this country.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h1>Requirements</h1>
          <h1>Future Proofing:</h1>
          <p>are there so the game can be used by others who want to work on this project in the future.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1>Funtionality:</h1>
          <p>of the atlas game is to be interesting and work with the set controls that the atlas game has itself and also function well.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1>Usability:</h1>
        <p>of the atlas game is to not glitch or be buggy at all and run smoothly.</p>
          <br>
          <br>

          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <br>
        <h3>I need a type of ai that can check whether it and the user is writing the correct words for the game and also if the same for the computer/ai itself as well as it'll play with the user<h3>
        <h3> I also need to debug the atlas game a lot</h3>
        <h3> I need to have comments above each of my important code so people can ynderstand what it is<h3>          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h1>Explanations for the Overview</h1>
          <b><p>I will also make these things happen by :-</p>
            <h3><li>By testing the atlas game multiple times to make sure the semi-ai checker isn't buggy</li>
              <li>I'll also make the atlas game work without any bugs by checking the code again and again and doing multiple playtests</li>
              <li>I'll make the atlas game future proof by adding commeents that are clear and understandable</li></b></h3>
              <br>
              <p> The game I am making or have made is my groups own intellectual property since I am not copying anybody elses work</p>
              <p>I can prove this since if you look at other atlas games .</p>
