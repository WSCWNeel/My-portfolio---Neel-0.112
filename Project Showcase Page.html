    <h1> Project Showcase Page </h1>
    <br>
    <p> Hello this is the page you'll see all of my projects displayed on. But before I showcase all of the projects I have worked on that I can, I must explain who my end users are, they are employers for coders, who hire coders to program games, websites and more. The reason I would like to be hired as a coder is that I can be a efficient coder and a good team member and also since coding is one of my passions </p>
